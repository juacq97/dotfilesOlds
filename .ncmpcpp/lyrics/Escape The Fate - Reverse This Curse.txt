A withered past and a blurry future
My hearts on an auction
It goes out to the highest bid.

I live too fast, and I know I will lose her
But there is an option, to die is to live in her head.

So I'll hang on, never let go.
I dug this pain into my chest.
It's dead

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first.
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose, so let me tell you the truth.
A deadly wish but it should've come sooner

A corpse in a funeral that I would never attend.
There is a light on in the back of this house
But you're not around, to die is to live in her head.
So I'll hang on, never let go.

I dug this pain into my chest.
It's dead.
One last chance to reverse this curse

You stole my heart but I had it first.
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth.
So, this goes, out to, the ones that fall in love
And to, the girl, that filled my dark.

Last night I had the weirdest dream
That you and I drove up the darkest streets
Passing through these city lights
Closure for the kiss that died.
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first

And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth.
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth.
(whisper) This goes
Out to
The ones that fall in love
And to the girl
That filled my dark
