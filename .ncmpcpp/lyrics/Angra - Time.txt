This time I wanna know
what life means...
...to live it again
I'm looking forward, feel the
light shine in my eyes...
And now I know, my instincts
were not wrong,
and many things can be done
I don't believe now,
That I'm dreaming alone
Oh, we're searching for the love
that everyone's got,
but can't see (yeah)
Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
there's so much hidden behind
as so much more we've gotta give...
Sanity brings up the sadness
that keeps your illusions locked
in a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
in a cage of conclusions
crowding your mind
You sit back bowing your head,
every answer - yes
Why don't you trust me
and shed out your fears,
Running over
the tears you've contained
now cover up your eyes,
-Is it good for you?

I will be here when fire burns!...

Welcome on board
over here is the ship of your life
So rotten
that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby
all the night
And if you get lost
you can hold my hand...

And I'll be here when fire burns
(inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!
Life make us feel
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live
a tale already told
Time make us heal
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away...
And I'll be here when fire burns
(inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!
Life make us feel (life make us feel)
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live (time make us live)
a tale already told
Time make us heal (time make us heal)
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away...
