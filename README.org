#+title: Welcome to my dotfiles

[[screenshot.png]]

This is a backup of my configuration files! Maybe (most probably not, but maybe) you'll find something neat here.

Right now, and after a few years of using Tiling Window Managers [[https://juancastro.xyz/en/migrating-to-plasma.html][I'm using KDE Plasma 5]]! Yeah, weird, I know. I keep my configuration for a lot of programs here though. I'm using Arch Linux btw.

This README is just the list of programs I'm using right now. Here's some links to the configs, I think, are the most interesting (not all of them are org files yet).

* Plasma Desktop Environment

Though it's possible to just install  the =plasma=  group and the =kde-applications= metapackage, that will get a lot of undesired applications, so I narrowed the list of applications I want to install.

#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.repos/dotfiles/plasma.pkgs
  plasma-meta
  dolphin
  konsole
  ark
  dolphin-plugins
  kcalc
  kcolorchooser
  kio-extras
  spectacle
  sddm-kcm
  plasma-pass
#+end_src

+ Plasma-meta: All the core packages for plasma. This includes some bloat, like the thunderbolt configuration, a firewall configuration and the discovery application, but I can live with it.
+ Dolphin: The default file manager for KDE. Most of the time I use dired, but sometimes a good graphical manager is useful
+ Konsole: The KDE terminal. I use Alacritty most of the time, but some KDE applications expect konsole
+ Ark: An archive program. Again, if I need to compress something from dolphin
+ Dolphin-plugins: Plugins for dolphin
+ Kcalc: A simple graphical calculator, I use this sometimes
+ Kcolorchooser: When I need to pick a color from the screen I normally use =gcolor2=, but let's use the Qt alternative better.
+ Kio-extras: Extra support for KIO
+ Spectacle: The KDE screenshot application
+ sddm-kcm: Adds sddm to the settings
+ Plasma-pass: An applet for the pass password manager.

** Extensions
I use a lot krunner extensions, Plasma themes and icon packs that are only available from the AUR:

#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.repos/dotfiles/plasma.pkgs
  plasma5-applets-window-buttons
  krunner-pass-git
  plasma5-runners-symbols
  lightly-qt
  flattery-icon-theme-git
  fluent-icon-theme-git
#+end_src

Some extensions and plasmoid are downloaded using the Plasma "get more" button.

* Other applications
I use a lot of other programs, most of them not part of KDE

** Multimedia programs
#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.repos/dotfiles/misc.pkgs
  mpv
  sxiv
  pqiv
  gimp
  krita
  ffmpeg
  playerctl
  youtube-dl
  #+end_src
  
** Office, documents and archives
#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.repos/dotfiles/misc.pkgs
  libreoffice-still
  libreoffice-still-es
  zathura
  zathura-pdf-mupdf
  poppler
  unzip
  p7zip
  unzip
  zip
  unrar
  nextcloud-client
  #+end_src
  
** Nerd stuff
#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.repos/dotfiles/misc.pkgs
  htop
  brightnessctl
  pamixer
  pass
  pass-otp
  passff-host
  libnotify
  wmctrl
  xclip
  rofi
  alacritty
  kdeconnect
  zsh
  zsh-theme-powerlevel10k
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-completions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  #+end_src
** Fonts
#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.repos/dotfiles/misc.pkgs
  ttf-liberation
  ttf-joypixels
  ttf-opensans
  ttf-fira-code
  ttf-fira-sans
  ttf-fira-mono
  ttf-font-awesome
 #+end_src

* Standalone Window Managers
If I return to stand alone window managers, then I'll need this applications:

#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/.repos/dotfiles/wm.pkgs
  dunst
  sxhkd
  nitrogen
  clipmenu
  redshift
  lxappearance
  picom
  pavucontrol
#+end_src

* Why do you tangle those *.pkgs files?

I'm glad you ask, those are simple text files with a list of programs I want in three categories:
+ plasma.pkgs: plasma packages
+ misc.pkgs: Miscelaneous packages that I'll install not matter what desktop environment I'm using
+ wm.pkgs: Packages I need only if I use an standalone window manager.

  To install one of those lists just need to run the command ~sudo pacman -S $(cat <list>)~ where <list> is the file I want (the plasma.pkgs list needs to be installed with yay instead).
